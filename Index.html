                <p class="Meintrop">Hey! My name is Atharva Soni, and this is my blog about 3 of my interests, the following being Drake, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Cars (generally). I know these choices are very random, but it's because I needed to make his website in 2 days and learn a lot of HTML because something like this is hard for me, especially as a beginner, to make. Obviously, this is a page about me, an entire website that I had to code ground up from HTML with minimal assistance, so why not talk a little bit about the person who created this website in the first place. One thing about me that I think is cool is that I know how to play 5 instruments, which I don't know if people find that impressive but I do. Another thig about me is that I love stocks and finance, and would like to go to college to pursue a career like that (not quant, thats way too hard to get into). I've been working on a few coding projects personally to develop my skills (which I know a lot of you guys are doing) and for some fun because Computer Science is an intruging subject to learn about. I'll probably post them onto my github later (My ID is djshiesty. I know it's corny but I made it when I was like 13 and that stuff was cool to me). Another thing about me is that I watch Basketball (Lebron is the GOAT), Football, and Soccer. Baseball is fun to play and follow but watching it is very boring. A lot of which I'm gonna talk about is filler so there isn't much to look at really.Honestly, a lot of what I’m writing here is just filler so there’s something on the page, but hey, that’s what a blog is for anyway, and if I’m already typing all this out I might as well keep going because the more I write, the more it looks like I actually planned this whole thing out instead of scrambling to put everything together last minute, which, if I’m being real, is exactly what happened. And since I’m already rambling, I guess I should mention that building a website like this really makes you realize how many tiny details go into even the simplest pages—like structuring text, organizing images, balancing colors, figuring out why one div refuses to move two pixels to the left no matter how much you beg it. It’s kind of funny because as I was working on this project, I kept switching between feeling like a genius for getting something small to work and feeling completely clueless the moment something else broke for no reason, but I guess that’s part of the process when you’re learning. And in a weird way, all this filler actually helps me explain myself more, since it shows that even though the site might look simple, there’s a lot of time, energy, and panic behind it, and honestly that’s probably true for every beginner project ever. So if you’re still reading this, just know that half of this paragraph exists purely so the page looks full and complete, and the other half is me realizing I can basically talk forever when no one tells me to stop.</p>
